# Overiew
This project is meant to be a simple Python application, which enables a user to play a simple coin flip game. The user gets the option to pick heads or tails and then a random option is picked (as would occur in a coin flip) and the results get printed and the total score gets added for every round that is played. 

Overall this project enabled me to further my knowledge of Python and it has helped me understand the basic syntax and rules for using the language.


## What I learnt: 

* **Global keyword** - I quickly learnt about the global keyword as when it came for my functions to reassign a variable value they was empty (as assigned in the global scope), which lead me to do more research around accessing variables within functions and I soon found that I needed to use the *Global* keyword.

* **Using Str() and Int()** - I learnt a lot using the Str() and Int() functions, needing to have variables converted to the correct data type when using them in strings or for maths.

* **Debugging** - I had to debug my programme to get use to a new programming language and this enabled me to start understanding the language more.
